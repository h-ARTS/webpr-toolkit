# **Webpr toolkit**

This repository is a treasure trove of utility functions and unique approaches tailored to tackle a variety of JavaScript problems. It is not only a testament to the versatile nature of JavaScript, but also a reflection of the learning journey undertaken in the webpr course.

In addition, the repository features a series of interactive games, each one a practical application of the concepts and tools explored throughout the course. From the basics of JavaScript syntax to advanced topics like closures, lambdas, asynchronous code, these games serve as a fun, hands-on way to cement your understanding.

## **Getting Started**
To dive into the games and utilities, you have several options:

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: With the Live Server extension installed, you can simply right-click on any `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" to start playing a game or testing a utility.

- **JetBrains WebStorm**: In this IDE, starting a live server is as simple as clicking on any browser icon available at the top-right corner of the code editor when you have an `index.html` file open.

- **Directly in the Browser**: Simply open any `index.html` file directly in your browser to start playing a game or testing a utility.

Through this repository, you'll gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript, applying its features and quirks to solve real-world problems and build engaging games. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a coding novice, there's something here for you to learn, to enjoy, and to be inspired by.

Happy coding!
